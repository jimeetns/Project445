Configuration Instruction -----

Download the Project445 folder from Github repository,  
Please ensure that you have downloaded the Project445 folder, which has all the java files and the csv files which serve as the data-source, in the “Home/<username>/” folder. The reason I am insisting to download at this location is because the paths to the csv files are referring to the csv files saved at this relative location via a getabsolutepath functionality.

Set executable permission by running chmod u+x BuildScript.sh


Build and Deploy Instructions -----

Once you have downloaded the Project to this location, please run the script (BuildScript.sh) which you will find inside the Project445 folder. This will install the necessary set-ups and get this program ready to run.


Copyright and Licencing -----

Known Bugs -----

I have incorporated Data persistence and for this it uses the csv files. Sadly my logic somehow requires that the csv files have atleast one entry inside it, with a blank csv file or no csv file at the desired path, the program will fail to run. As long as you download this folder from the GIT and run the Script file as noted earlier, you will not have to worry about it. So there is nothing at you end that you have to do.
